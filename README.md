# LangChain OpenAI Integration Example

This repository demonstrates how to integrate LangChain with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model using a simple Python script. The project loads API keys from a `.env` file and generates AI-powered explanations for topics such as machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

## Repository Structure

- **main.py**  
  The primary Python script that loads environment variables, invokes the language model, and prints the generated output.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Contains the list of required libraries to run the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create and activate a virtual environment:

- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository to store your API keys. For example, add your OpenAI API key as follows:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

> **Note:** Ensure you have a valid API key from OpenAI and any other providers you intend to use.

## Running the Script

To run the project, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will load your API key from the `.env` file, invoke the language model, and print the generated explanation to the console.

## Libraries and Integrations

This project utilizes several libraries and integrations:

- **LangChain & LangChain Core:** Frameworks for developing applications with language models.
- **OpenAI & langchain-openai:** Integration for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Anthropic Integration:** For potential use with Anthropic's language models.
- **Google Gemini (PaLM) Integration:** For future integration with Googleâ€™s generative AI models.
- **Hugging Face Integration:** Provides support for transformers and accessing models via Hugging Face.
- **Python-Dotenv:** Manages environment variables loaded from the `.env` file.
- **Machine Learning Utilities:** Libraries such as `numpy` and `scikit-learn` for potential ML enhancements.
